# GoIgniter

An attempt to extend CodeIgniter3 without breaking all the good things. You can play around with it before CodeIgniter4 is ready, and you can still play around with it after CodeIgniter4 is ready. By using GoIgniter, you can do cool stuff without breaking your current working code.

Every code works in CodeIgniter3 will also works in GoIgniter.

Personally, I made this as core foundation of No-CMS 2.0

# Philosophy

* Perfection is simply never exists.

    CodeIgniter3 is doing it right by supporting migration. In fact, it is almost impossible to write a script that is 100% working without any attempt to fix it later. Instead of trying to do so, build the simplest part possible, and gradually scale it.

* If something is not broken, don't fix it.

    CodeIgniter3 is stable enough. Some new technologies such as namespace might not be used extensively. The `$this->load->model()` might be ugly, but it has work since 2010, so let it be.

* If something is broken (outdated), find out which part exactly it is, and only fix/improve that part.

    Sometime recode things from scratch is necessary, but most of the time, you can just extend and improve.

* Do as little changes as possible, and only do it when necessary.

    You are lazy, it is good, and you should keep it that way :)

# Minimum requirement

* PHP 5.4, since I use `anonymous function`

# How to start

* If you use xampp, put this on `C:\xampp\htdocs`, open your browser, and type this url: `http://localhost/GoIgniter`
* If you want to use php's default server, type `php amigo serve` in your terminal, open your browser, and type this url: `http://localhost:8080`
* If you have composer, please run `composer install` to get the newest packages (especiall twig) instead of using old fallback packages.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

If you use GoIgniter in production, please create `application/core/config/config.php` and set `$config['hostname']` to your `hostname`. e.g:

```php
    <?php
    $config['hostname'] = 'somedomain.com';
    // or $config['hostname'] = 'localhost';
```

This is important to avoid `host header injection` attacks. 

# Feature

* HMVC with namespace
* `run_module_controller()` which is better than HMVC's `Modules::run`
* static file management with `asset_url()`
* The way of initiating helper, model, or library is very similar to CodeIgniter4
* Still compatible with PHP 5.4 (Contrast to CodeIgniter4 that will only support PHP7)
* Extended routes (including option to disable autoroute)
* Extended config
* Better Unit Test Library 
* Using twig, but the old `<?php ?>` tag is still allowed in the view
* ORM

# Modified files

These are some files that was modified or added in GoIgniter:

* `assets/`
* `composer.json` (This file is different from CodeIgniter's, please make sure to not overwrite this when you update CodeIgniter)
* `index.php` (This file is different from CodeIgniter's, please make sure to not overwrite this when you update CodeIgniter)
* `application/core/config/`
* `application/core/go_init.php`
* `application/core/CI_Controller.php`
* `application/core/Module_Migrator.php`
* `application/core/MY_CodeIgniter.php`
* `application/core/MY_Config.php`
* `application/core/MY_Loader.php`
* `application/core/MY_Router.php`
* `application/core/Go_Model.php`
* `application/core/Unit_test.php`
* `application/core/Twig` (This is just for fallback scenario, install composer and GoIgniter will use composer's twig)
* `application/views/modules/`

# The cool things

GoIgniter let you have HMVC structure without using HMVC Plugin, However the HMVC style is a bit different from the original.

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/test/controllers/Mycontroller.php
    namespace Modules\Test\Controllers;

    class Mycontroller extends \CI_Controller{

        function index(){
            $model = new \Modules\Test\Models\MyModel();
            helper('test/date');
            $data = array(
                    'articles' => $model->get_data(),
                    'date'     => get_date()
                    );
            view('test/MyView', $data);
        }

        function harambe($act){
            echo 'All hail harambe !!!'.PHP_EOL;
            echo 'Harambe is '.$act;
            if(isset($_GET['food']))
            {
                echo PHP_EOL . 'Give ' . $_GET['food'] . ' to harambe';
            }
        }

    }
```

First, look at the controller. Pretty similar to normal CodeIgniter's. But as many cool PHP framework out there, here, you should use `namespace`. At first, this might looks like an extra works, but this will gives you at least two advantages:

* You no longer need to worry about class collision
* Switching to other cool framework out there (laravel, symfony, codeigniter4, etc) will be easier

Also, now you do `$model = new \Modules\Test\Models\MyModel();` instead of `$this->load->model('mymodel');`. This is also a good practice. Err, actually no, the best practice is this:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/test/controllers/Mycontroller.php
    namespace Modules\Test\Controllers;
    use \Modules\Test\Models\MyModel as Model;

    class Mycontroller extends \CI_Controller{
        function index()
        {
            $model = new Model();
            // and the rest of your code
        }
    }

```

This make things more explicit, as well as avoiding class collision. And if you don't want to change your coding style too much, you can also use this `$this->model = new Model();`.

If you take a closer look, you will also notice, that we now use `helper('helper_name')` and `view('view_name')` instead of `$this->load->helper('helper_name')` and `$this->load->view('view_name')`. 

Too much changes? Don't worry, try to put any model, view, and controller in your `application`, and you can load them all just as the original CodeIgniter!!!

That's cool, but you will see something cooler in the `view`.

```php 
    <!-- file location: modules/test/views/MyView.php -->
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <h2><?=$date?></h2>
    <?php 
    foreach($articles as $article){
        echo '<h4>' . $article['title'] . '</h4>';
        echo $article['content'];
    }

    echo '<pre>';
    run_module_controller('test/mycontroller/harambe/run?food=banana');
    echo '</pre>';

    var_dump($_GET)
    ?>
```

Yes, you have `run_module_controller` function, that can be called anywhere!!!

Some people hate it. In case of you hate it, just don't use it. However, in many workflow (as if you want to make widget mechanism, which the widget can also be accessed as independent page), this is going to be very useful.

You can also put some `GET` query when running other controller, and the original `$_GET` value won't be affected.

For example, I try to access this url `http://localtest.me/GoIgniter/index.php/test/mycontroller?food=pancake`. And I get this as the result:

```
    Hello world
    2016-12-24
    Sun
    Closest sun
    Moon
    Rock

    All hail harambe !!!
    Harambe is 'run'
    Give banana to harambe

    /home/gofrendi/public_html/GoIgniter/application/views/modules/test/MyView.php:13:
    array (size=1)
      'food' => string 'pancake' (length=7)

```

Firstly, `$_GET["food"]` contains `pancake`. But when you call `test/mycontroller/harambe/run?food=banana`, `$_GET["food"]` is changed to `banana`. Later, when you run `var_dump($_GET)`, it will give you a `pancake`.

# Per Module Migration

CodeIgniter was built with single MVC in mind. While this make things simple, sometime, we really need to separate our codes into several modules. When it come to database migration, it should works the same way. In GoIgniter, you can perform per-module-migration by doing this:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/test/controllers/Test_migration
    namespace Modules\Test\Controllers;

    use \Module_Migrator;
    class Test_migration extends \CI_Controller
    {
        function index()
        {
            $migrator = new Module_Migrator();
            $migrator->migrate_all();

            // you can also do this:
            // $migrator->migrate_all('current', array('test' => 0, 'cms' => '20161030'))
            // This will only migrate test to version 0, and cms to version 20161030

            // you can also do this:
            // $migrator->migrate('blog', 'current', 0)
            // This will only migrate blog to version 0
        }
    }
```

# Extended Configuration

In GoIgniter, you can extend CodeIgniter's configuration by creating `application/core/config/config.php`.
While this is not as convenient as `.env` in CodeIgniter4 or Laravel, this can help you a lot. Since `config.php` is just another php script, I can do everything here. Load an independent json file seems to be more convenient than put your configuration in `application/config/` and accidentally overwrite it...

```php
    <?php defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');

    // This was created by cms module's Genesis 
    $_cms_config_file = MODULEPATH.'cms/json/configuration.json';
    if(file_exists($_cms_config_file))
    {
        $_json = file_get_contents($_cms_config_file);
        $_cms_config = json_decode($_json, TRUE);
        foreach($_cms_config as $key=>$val)
        {
            $config[$key] = $val;
        }
    }
```

Two new keys are introduced in extended configuration:

* `$config['hostname']`
* `$config['asset_url']` 

Also, you can extend database configuration here, by doing something like:

* `$config['db.default.database'] = 'tests';` As, you've notice, `default` is database active group.

Not only database, you can also overwrite all codeigniter's library's configuration here. For example you want to change `migration_table` into `'cms_migration'`. Here is how you do that: `$config['migration.migration_table'] = 'cms_migration';`

# Extended Route

In GoIgniter, you can also extend CodeIgniter's routing by creating `application/core/config/routes.php`.
This will override any route configuration defined in `application/config/routes.php`.

Also, `$route['disable_autoroute']` is now introduced. Set it to TRUE, and no magical autorouting anymore.
Beware, if you set `$route['disable_autoroute']`, even default controller route will not work, and you have to define `$route['']` to your `supposed-to-be-default-controller` instead.

# Constants

Three new constants are introduced in GoIgniter.

* MODULEPATH
* ASSETPATH
* EXTCONFIGPATH

You can change the values by editing `index.php`

# ORM

The ORM in GoIgniter is much simpler compared to Laravel's and much more powerful compared to CI 4.
Here is a simple model:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/cms/models/Test_Node.php
    namespace Modules\Cms\Models;

    class Test_Node extends \Go_Model
    {
    }
```

While you make a Model like this, GoIgniter will try to guess table name based on class name.
It will also try to fill out other configuration automatically.

But let's make a full featured model for now:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/cms/models/Test_Node.php
    namespace Modules\Cms\Models;

    class Test_Node extends \Go_Model
    {
        protected $_table = 'test_node';        // Table's name
        protected $_id = 'id';                  // Primary key
        protected $_created_at = 'created_at';  // field for creation date logging
        protected $_updated_at = 'updated_at';  // field for update date logging
        protected $_deleted_at = 'deleted_at';  // field for "soft deletion" logging
        protected $_deleted = 'deleted';        // field for "soft deletion" flag
        protected $_columns = ['code', 'parent_id', 'child_count']; // Other fields
        protected $_unique_columns = ['code'];  // Set of columns that act as "unique key"
        protected $_turn_off_cache = FALSE;     // ORM operations need to run a lot of query. If turn_off_cache is FALSE, then Go_Model will always try to use as minimal "SELECT" as possible

        protected $code = 'default'; // property that represent field's default value

        protected $_children = array( // children of this table (i.e: one-to-many relation)
            'children' => array(
                'model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node',
                'foreign_key' => 'parent_id',
                'on_delete' => 'set_null', // restrict, cascade, set_null
                'on_purge' => 'set_null', // restric, cascade, set_null
            ),
        );

        protected $_parents = array( // parent of this table (i.e: many-to-one relation)
            'parent' => array(
                'model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node',
                'foreign_key' => 'parent_id',
            ),
        );

        protected function before_save(&$success, &$error_message) // what should we do before save
        {
            $this->child_count = count($this->children);
        }
    }
```

And here is how to use it:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/cms/controllers/Test.php
    namespace Modules\Cms\Controllers;

    use \Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node;

    class Test extends CI_Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
           $array = array(
                'code' => 'Ned Stark',
                'children' => array(
                    array('code' => 'Robb Stark'),
                    array('code' => 'Jon Snow'),
                    array('code' => 'Sansa Stark'),
                    array('code' => 'Arya Stark'),
                    array('code' => 'Brandon Stark'),
                ), 
                'parent' => array('code' => 'Rickard Stark'),
            );

            // Creating a new test_node
            $test_node = new Test_Node($array);

            // save it
            $test_node->save();

            // test how many records available in the database
            var_dump($this->db->count_all('test_node')); // should be 7

            // delete Robb (Soft delete, behind the scene, nothing is actually deleted. We just set `deleted` into `TRUE`
            $robb = $test_node->childre[0];
            $robb->delete();

            // purge Robb (now delete Robb forever)
            $robb->purge();

            // test how many records available in the database
            var_dump($this->db->count_all('test_node')); // should be 6, Robb is gone

            // Get Node by id
            $rickard = Test_Node::find_by_id(1);
            var_dump($rickard->code); // should be Rickard Stark
            var_dump($rickard->child_count); // should be 1

            // Get all node
            $node_list = Test_Node::find_all();
            var_dump(count($node_list)); // should be 6

            // Create some other nodes
            $cersei = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'cersey lannister'));
            $joffrey = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'joffrey baratheon'));
            $myrcella = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'myrcella baratheon'));
            $tommen = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'tommen baratheon'));

            // Using add and remove for children manipulation
            // For each children, you can use `add_` and `remove_` function
            $cersei->add_child($joffrey);
            $cersei->add_child($myrcella);
            $cersei->add_child($tommen);

            $cersei->save(); // save cersei with her children

            $cersei->remove_child($joffrey);
            var_dump(count($cersei->children)); // should give you 2, since joffrey has been removed
            var_dump($joffrey->parent); // should give you NULL, since joffrey has been removed from cersei's children, now joffrey is son of no one

            // ORM is cool, but I want to try query
            $node_list = Test_Node::find_by_query("SELECT * FROM test_node WHERE code LIKE '%snow%'")
            var_dump($node_list[0]->code); // And yeah, Jon Snow

            // Note: This will also work
            // $node_list = Test_Node::find_by_query($this->db->select('*')->from('test_node')->like('code', 'snow'));

        }
    }
```

# ORM Many To Many

Many to many is actually never exists. However in some cases, accessing data with many-to-many scenario is much more convenient compared to double layered `one-to-many`. I can't find any better example, but in some culture there is polyandry and polygamy marriage. Let's modify our node a bit

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/cms/models/Test_Node.php
    namespace Modules\Cms\Models;

    // This is the pivot model.
    class Test_Node_Marriage extends \Go_Model
    {
        protected $_table = 'test_node_marriage';
        protected $_columns = ['husband_id', 'wife_id'];

        protected $_parents = array(
            'husband' => array(
                'model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node',
                'foreign_key' => 'husband_id',
            ),
            'wife' => array(
                'model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node',
                'foreign_key' => 'wife_id',
            ),
        );

    }


    class Test_Node extends \Go_Model
    {
        protected $_table = 'test_node';
        protected $_columns = ['code', 'parent_id', 'child_count'];
        protected $_unique_columns = ['code'];

        protected $_many_to_many = array(
            'wife' => array(
                'pivot_model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node_Marriage',
                'backref_relation' => 'husband',
                'relation' => 'wife',
                'on_delete' => 'set_null',
            ),
            'husband' => array(
                'pivot_model' => 'Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node_Marriage',
                'backref_relation' => 'wife',
                'relation' => 'husband',
                'on_delete' => 'set_null',
            )
        );

    }

```

You can use the ORM as follow:

```php
    <?php // file location: modules/cms/controllers/Test.php
    namespace Modules\Cms\Controllers;

    use \Modules\Cms\Models\Test_Node;

    class Test extends CI_Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            // initiate arjuna with a wife
            $ulupi = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'ulupi'));
            $arjuna = new Test_Node(array(
                'code' => 'arjuna',
                'wife' => array($ulupi), 
            ));
            $bhima = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'bhima'));
            $draupadi = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'draupadi'));
            $subadhra = new Test_Node(array('code' => 'subadhra'));

            // add and remove many to many relation
            $arjuna->add_wife($draupadi);
            $arjuna->add_wife($subadhra);
            $arjuna->remove_wife($ulupi);

            $draupadi->add_husband($bhima);

            var_dump(count($draupadi->husband)); // should yield 2. draupadi has 2 husbands: arjuna and bhima
            var_dump(count($arjuna->wife)); // should yield 2, arjuna has 2 wife: draupadi and subadhra, since ulupi has been removed

            // draupadi is connected to arjuna and bhima, so this should save all node except ulupi (since ulupi is not connected to anyone)
            $draupadi->save();
            // this will save ulupi
            $ulupi->save();
        }
    }
````

# ORM Magic

Like in Laravel's Eloquent, Go_Model also allows you to define your own magical `setter` and `getter` easily.

Also, in Go_Model, you can define pseudo composite unique key by using `_unique_columns` attribute. This is useful for a case when you don't want users ends up with the same user_name.

Let's see this example:

```php
    <?php
    class User_Model extends Go_Model 
    {
        protected $_table      = 'cms_user';
        protected $_columns    = ['user_name', 'hashed_password', 'email'];
        protected $_unique_columns = ['user_name'];

        public function set_password($val)
        {
            $this->hashed_password = md5($val);
        }

        public function get_password()
        {
            return $this->hashed_password != ''? 'PASSWORD SET' : 'PASSWORD NOT SET';
        }
    }
````

You can use the model like this:

```php
    <?php

    $user = new User_Model(array(
        'user_name' => 'Kira Yamato',
        'password' => 'kira',
        'email' => 'kira@junioseven.com',
    ));
    $user->save();

    $user = User_Model::find_by_id(1);
    $user->password = 'new password';
    $user->save();

    var_dump($user->password); // should give you 'PASSWORD SET'
```

# ORM Trivia

If you have exactly one unique columns (defined by using `$_unique_columns` property), you can pass a `string` to the constructor.

```php
    class Test_Node extends \Go_Model
    {
        protected $_unique_columns = ['code'];
    }

    $node = new Test_Node('Test');
    var_dump($node->code); // should give you 'Test'
```

The following methods are also available and can be overridden as necessary:

* `as_array()`
* `as_string()`
* `as_short_string()`

# Always loaded functions

These functions are always available, either in models, views, or controllers

* `asset_url($url = '', $protocol = NULL)`
* `site_url($url = '', $protocol = NULL)` --> This will also detect multisite
* `base_url($url = '', $protocol = NULL)`
* `cache_file($src_file, $dst_file)` 
* `get_available_modules()`
* `helper($helpers = array())`
* `view($view, $data = array(), $return = FALSE)`
* `run_module_controller($url, $return = FALSE)`
* `run_routed_module($url, $return = FALSE)`
* `cache_modules()`

# Soon to be added

* CMS Module (In progress)
* Amigo CLI (In progress)
* Unit testing (Failed, use CI's default)
* CodeIgniter4 like Model & Entity (Failed, do another approach)
* Multisite (done)
* Laravel's like blade engine (No need, use twig instead)
* ORM many-to-many
* Middleware by using anotation in CMS Controller

# The bad things

* I made `application\views\modules\` to cache the original view. Whenever original view updated, and someone access the url, the cache will be updated. This is good, and I also check modification time of the file, so there is no unnecessary `write-to-disk` operation. But it surely add several micro seconds to response time. The same mechanism also works for asset (static file) management.

* There might be some 'reinventing-the-wheel' thing here.

* In ORM, you cannot set a record as a child of itself.
